His fingers circle the rim of the cup he’s holding, condensation cold against his skin,
something steady to anchor him.

He waits for the shift—that subtle pulling away.

Instead, Saharsh just listens. Really listens.

For what it’s worth… I’m not going anywhere.”

Something rearranges itself quietly inside Calvin’s chest.`,

He lifts his drink for a sip instead, using the familiar motion as a shield,
and jokes about professors and cafeteria food,
carefully skimming above the deeper parts of himself.

Even so, when the wind picks up, Saharsh nudges his shoulder and asks,
“Are you really okay, though? You seem… distant sometimes.”

“I’m fine,” Calvin lies.

Saharsh doesn’t push. He just stays. That, somehow, is even louder than questions.`,

the way his chest loosens when Saharsh laughs,
the way his day tilts brighter when a message from him pops up,
the way a casual “made it home safe?” text lingers in his mind.

One night, scrolling up through months of messages, cup of tea going cold beside him, it finally clicks:
this isn’t just a friend crush.

“Oh,” Calvin whispers to the empty room. “Oh.”

trying to sound casual and failing.

He picks at the edge of his bottle’s label, plastic flaking beneath his nails.

“I’m trying,” Saharsh replies, tired. “I’m just… juggling a lot.”

Neither of them is really angry—not at each other, anyway—

Hurt and defensiveness pile up on top of all the things they haven’t said:
I miss you. I need you. I’m scared of wanting you this much.

There’s a long silence after the last sharp word.

Calvin takes a slow sip from his drink just to have something to do with his hands.

“It’s just…” Calvin swallows. “All those nights, walks, messages…
You became my favorite part of every day without me noticing.

Somewhere along the line, I stopped thinking of you as just my best friend.”

He looks up, meeting his eyes.

Overdramatic as always.”

There are a lot of words and also very few:
how long it’s been, how scared they both were,
how close they came to never saying anything.

At some point, hands find each other—
awkwardly at first, then steadier.

A forgotten drink sits nearby, growing warm or cold,
no longer needed as a distraction.

“I don’t know what the future looks like,” Calvin says.

Some days are glowing and easy:
video calls that last until one of them falls asleep,
shared playlists titled “us”, photos of sunsets sent back and forth,
Calvin always on screen with some new drink in hand.

Some days are harder:
missed calls, bad internet, exhaustion, quiet fears.

But there is a steady thread through all of it—
the choice, over and over, to show up for each other.

Years from now, Calvin will still remember the color of the sky
that first night he said “I’m in love with you, Saharsh,” 
and heard “I’m in love with you too” in return.

It won’t be the end.

Time zones become something they learn to navigate:
a good-morning for one is a good-night for the other.
Screens glow in dark rooms, each a small window into the other’s life.

They build routines:
weekly calls, random photos, “this made me think of you” messages.

Calvin, of course, is always holding a mug or bottle in their calls;
it becomes a running joke that you can track his mood by what he’s drinking.

There are moments of ache, of missing the easy closeness of campus,
but never again the ache of not knowing how the other feels.

Years pass. Careers shift. Cities change.

Then he sees him.

Older, a little, in the way people change around the eyes.
Still entirely, unmistakably, wonderfully Saharsh.

They walk toward each other, then run the last few steps.

“I missed you,” Calvin breathes.

“I missed you more,” Saharsh answers, pulling back just enough to look at him.
“You know… I’m still in love with you.”

Calvin laughs, relief and joy tangled together.
